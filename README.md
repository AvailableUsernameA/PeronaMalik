**Optimized anisotropic diffusion implementation from pixel-wise loops (O(N^2)) to matrix-based operations (O(N) per iteration), shortening runtime to about 1/6. 
**Integrated optimized module into lab’s shared research pipeline. This significantly improved the overall efficiency of image processing workflows in the lab.
